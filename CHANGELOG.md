# Changelog

## 0.2.1 - unreleased

Looping playback, clearer pricing, reused release sources.

### Added

- Videos loop until you pause them.
- A bigger media viewer with a blurred backdrop.
- Previous and next in the history viewer and in every preview list.
- Reference button: adds the video as a reference, or its last frame as the start frame.

### Fixed

- The Generate button shows no price, discount or spinner while it cannot run.
- With looping playback the player controls stay in sync, and pausing stops the loop.
- A model with no endpoint pricing block now logs a clear reason and keeps list prices.
- Release pipeline: sidecar and ffmpeg source pulls that hit GHCR are reused instead of rebuilt.
- The preview shows Deselect for a selected file and keeps the list open while you pick.
- List rows toggle selection with a click, the same as the grid.
