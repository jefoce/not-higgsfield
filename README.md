## What you can do

- See the price before you press Generate, and keep the real cost with every video.
- Start from text, a picture, or a start and an end picture.
- Add reference pictures, clips or sound, and point to them in your text ("the person in Image 1").
- Browse, search and select many videos at once, and make any of them again with one click.
- Keep working while videos generate. You get a notification when one is ready.

## Models

- Wan 3.0 and Wan 3.0 Prime · 480p-1080p
- Seedance 2.0 · 480p-4K
- Seedance 2.5 · 480p-720p

Prices come live from OpenRouter.

## Wait, is this Higgsfield?

No. That is the whole point of the name.

| Name                   | What it is                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Not Higgsfield         | This app. Runs on your computer, uses your own OpenRouter key, keeps every video in a folder you own.                                                 |
| Not Not Higgsfield     | Two negatives cancel out, so this is Higgsfield. A different company with a different product, no relation to this repo. Go there for the real thing. |
| Not Not Not Higgsfield | Back to this app. We stopped counting here.                                                                                                           |

This is a clean-room project. It was written from scratch: no Higgsfield code, assets, logos, private API or internal material went into it. I liked how their app looks from the outside, the way anyone with a browser can see it, and then built our own house next door, with our own bricks.

## What you need

- A Mac (Apple Silicon), a Windows 10/11 PC, or 64-bit Linux with glibc 2.35+ (Ubuntu 22.04, Debian 12, Fedora 36 or newer).
- An OpenRouter account with some credit. One account gives you many video models, and you pay only for what you generate.
- Optional: a Cloudflare account with R2, only for models that take video or sound references. Cloudflare asks for a card to turn R2 on. The free tier is 10 GB, and the app stays under 8 GB. It deletes references it has not used for 30 days.

## Install

Download the file for your computer from the [Releases page](https://github.com/jefoce/not-higgsfield/releases/latest).

### macOS

1. Open the `.dmg` and drag Not Higgsfield into Applications.
2. Before the first launch, run this in Terminal: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Not Higgsfield.app"`
3. If macOS still blocks it, go to System Settings > Privacy & Security, press **Open Anyway** next to Not Higgsfield, and confirm.

> [!WARNING]
> The command is only for the file downloaded from this repo. It removes Apple's quarantine flag from that copy. Do not run it on an app you got from anywhere else.

### Windows

1. Run the `-setup.exe`.
2. If you see "Windows protected your PC", press **More info**, then **Run anyway**.

No administrator rights needed. The app appears in the Start menu.

### Linux

- **AppImage:** `chmod +x not-higgsfield-*-linux-x64.AppImage`, then run it.
  If it fails with a FUSE or `libfuse.so.2` error, install FUSE 2 once:
  - Ubuntu 22.04 or Debian 12: `sudo apt install libfuse2`
  - Ubuntu 24.04 or newer: `sudo apt install libfuse2t64`

  Install exactly that package, not `fuse`, which replaces `fuse3` and can remove system packages.
  No FUSE at all: `./not-higgsfield-*-linux-x64.AppImage --appimage-extract-and-run`.

- **Debian or Ubuntu:** `sudo apt install ./not-higgsfield-*-linux-x64.deb`. This is the simplest option on Ubuntu, and it also installs the video playback libraries.
- **Fedora or openSUSE:** `sudo dnf install ./not-higgsfield-*-linux-x64.rpm`.

Each release has a `SHA256SUMS.txt` if you want to check your download.

## Updates

The app checks 15 seconds after launch, then every 12 hours, and shows a notice when a new version exists. Settings → **App** has the switch for that check and **Check now**.

- **macOS and Windows:** **Install and restart** downloads the new version and installs it in place.
- **Linux AppImage:** the same button replaces the running AppImage.
- **Linux `.deb` and `.rpm`:** the app cannot replace a system package. **Download** opens the [Releases page](https://github.com/jefoce/not-higgsfield/releases/latest) so you install the new version as before.

On macOS, the first launch after an update asks for keychain access once. Choose **Always Allow**.

Version 0.1.0 has no updater. Install 0.2.0 by hand once from the Releases page. Later versions update themselves.

## Messages your computer may show

The app is not signed with a paid certificate yet, so your system asks more questions than usual. They are all normal.

### macOS

| When                                                                              | Message                                                         | Press                                                                                                                |

| You save keys                                                                     | "…wants to use your confidential information… in your keychain" | Your login password, then **Always Allow**. Pressed Deny? Save again, or delete "not-higgsfield" in Keychain Access. |
| First video is ready                                                              | "…would like to send you notifications"                         | **Allow**. Change it later in System Settings > Notifications.                                                       |
| You use a folder in Desktop, Documents, Downloads, a USB drive or a network share | "…would like to access files in…"                               | **Allow**. Otherwise turn it on in Privacy & Security > Files and Folders. Until then the folder looks empty.        |

After installing a new version by hand from a `.dmg`, run the `xattr` command again before the first launch, then Open Anyway if asked. Updates installed from Settings do not need it. Each unsigned version counts as a new app. The app never needs Full Disk Access, Accessibility, Screen Recording, Camera or Microphone.

### Windows

| When                                                             | Message                        | Press                                                                        |

| Saving to Documents or Pictures with Controlled folder access on | "Unauthorized changes blocked" | Windows Security > Ransomware protection > Allow an app, add Not Higgsfield. |

Keys go to Windows Credential Manager without a question.

### Linux

If your keyring is locked when you save keys, Linux asks for your login password. Cancel it and the keys are not saved, settings tells you. Without any keyring, keys go to a private file in your home folder.

## First setup

1. **OpenRouter (required).** Add credit, create a dedicated API key with a spend limit, and paste it in Settings (gear icon). [Step-by-step guide](docs/user/OPENROUTER.md)
2. **Cloudflare R2 (only for video or sound references).** Create a bucket and a token for it, then paste four values in Settings. Free up to 10 GB, and the app stays under 8 GB. Cloudflare asks for a card. [Step-by-step guide](docs/user/CLOUDFLARE-R2.md)

Both guides are also linked in the app: gear icon → **Setup guide**.

## Make your first video

1. Pick the cheapest model at 480p and a short length to try.
2. Describe what should happen. Optional: open the picker beside the generator and click a picture or clip to attach it. Click it again to remove it. In Frames, a click picks the file and closes the picker. Call them Image 1, Video 1, Audio 1 in your text. You can also paste or drop files anywhere in the window. They go to the open picker or to the active tab.
3. Press **Generate**. The button shows the price. You have 10 seconds to cancel before anything is sent or paid.

## Keep the app running until your video is done

The one thing to remember: the video is made on OpenRouter, but the app brings it to your computer. OpenRouter keeps finished videos only for a while (about a day for some models).

- **macOS:** the red close button only hides the window. Quit with Cmd+Q.
- **Windows and Linux:** closing the window quits.
- Quit anyway? Videos keep generating, and the app downloads them when you open it again. Do that within a few hours.
- Don't let the computer sleep for long during a generation.

## What the statuses mean

| Status                | What is happening                                        | OK to quit?                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |

| Failed                | Usually not charged. The card says why                   | Yes                            |
| Expired               | Charged if it finished. Check OpenRouter activity        | Yes                            |
| Cancelled             | Never sent, nothing charged                              | Yes                            |

## Where your videos are

Everything is in `.not-higgsfield` in your home folder (hidden, on macOS press Cmd+Shift+. in Finder).

- `downloads`: your videos with a preview and settings for each.
- `uploads`: pictures and clips you pasted or dropped. Files picked from your disk are not copied, only linked.
- `.cache` and `runtime`: thumbnails and the app's server copy. Safe to delete while the app is closed.

To back up or move to a new computer, copy the whole folder, then enter your keys again.

## Costs and privacy

- Not Higgsfield is free and adds no fee. The wallet pill shows what is left of your key's credit limit, or your account balance when you add a management key.
- No account, no tracking, no server of ours. Keys stay in your system keychain.
- Your text and pictures go to OpenRouter and the model's provider. Video and sound references go to your own R2 bucket as private links that expire after 2 hours.
- R2 stays inside Cloudflare's free tier, see [the R2 guide](docs/user/CLOUDFLARE-R2.md).

## Keyboard shortcuts

- `Left` and `Right`: previous or next item in the viewer or a preview list.
- `Shift+Left` and `Shift+Right`: seek 5 seconds inside the viewer.
- `+` and `-`: zoom a photo in or out in the viewer.
- `0`: fit a zoomed photo back to the screen.
- `Space`: play or pause a focused player.
- `F`: fullscreen for a focused player.
- `Escape`: close a dialog or clear the selection.

## Uninstall

Delete the app, then the `.not-higgsfield` folder if you don't want your videos. Remove the saved keys by searching "not-higgsfield" in Keychain Access, Windows Credential Manager or your Linux keyring.

## What's next

Ideas, depending on how many people use the app: more video models, image generation, and simple editing (trim videos, crop and resize pictures). Want one sooner? Open or upvote an issue.
